  <!-- 1. INTRO -->
  <section id="about" class="section home-section visible">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="about-intro-heading">Learn. Build. Evolve.</h2>
      <p class="about-intro-lead">DeepTrics is a global platform for real-world internships, fellowships, and product development. We exist to bridge the gap between education and industry by giving students hands-on experience through real software, real teams, and real responsibility — not classroom simulations or paid certificates.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. WHY WE EXIST -->
  <section id="why-we-exist" class="section home-section home-section-alt">
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
      <p><strong>DeepTrics was not started for money.</strong> It was started to fix a real problem: students need real experience to get jobs, but many internships are paid, fake, or offer no real work. We believe you should not have to pay for experience, and you should not have to settle for work that does not count.</p>
      <p>We value curiosity, responsibility, and willingness to learn more than prior experience. Our programs are free for students and for institutions—globally.</p>
      <p class="about-motto">Empowering students, one real-world project at a time.</p>

      <h3>What We Offer</h3>
      <p class="section-lead">Programs and outcomes that put students first.</p>
      <ul class="gains-list do-list">
        <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>Free internships and fellowships</strong> — No fees for students or institutions. Opportunities in web development, app development, full stack, backend, UI/UX, data, and more.</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>Real-world projects</strong> — Students work on live products or client work, not simulations. They use industry tools (e.g. Git, agile practices) and ship real deliverables.</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>Mentorship and collaboration</strong> — Guidance from experienced practitioners, peer collaboration, and feedback so learning is structured and outcome-driven.</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>Portfolio and recognition</strong> — Work students can show to employers. Where applicable, we provide verification and support for resumes and interviews—experience first, certificates only as a record.</li>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>How We Sustain It</h3>
      <p>DeepTrics is funded through product development and client partnerships. We build software for our own products and for clients; that work funds the internship and fellowship programs. We do not collect fees from students or institutions. For more on our commercial work—custom software, design, and development—see <a href="services.html">Services</a>.</p>
