  <section id="challenges" class="section home-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Shared Global Challenges</h3>
      <p class="section-lead">Across regions, institutions face similar pressures. We understand them.</p>
      <ul class="process-list">
        <li><strong>Gap between academic learning and industry needs:</strong> What is taught in the classroom often lags behind what employers expect. Students need exposure to real tools, workflows, and expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited exposure to real product development:</strong> Many graduates have never worked on live software products or client deliverables. Theory alone does not build readiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Student readiness for modern software roles:</strong> Employers look for evidence of real work — code, collaboration, ownership. Students struggle to show this without structured opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure to improve graduate outcomes:</strong> Institutions are expected to deliver employable graduates. Ethical, scalable ways to add real-world experience are scarce.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>DeepTrics exists to bridge this gap — in partnership with institutions, not in place of them.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>The DeepTrics Model</h3>
      <p class="section-lead">What makes this different from classroom or simulation-based programs.</p>
      <ul class="process-list">
        <li><strong>Students work on real software products and live projects.</strong> Not simulations or dummy tasks. Actual products or client work that ships.</li>
        <li><strong>Experience is structured, supervised, and outcome-driven.</strong> Clear expectations, feedback, and support so learning is intentional.</li>
        <li><strong>Emphasis on teamwork, ownership, and accountability.</strong> Students collaborate in teams, use industry-style workflows (e.g. version control, agile practices, code review), and take responsibility for deliverables.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning happens by building.</strong> No paid classroom sessions. Growth comes from doing, with guidance from experienced practitioners.</li>

      <h3>How Institutions Can Collaborate</h3>
      <p class="section-lead">Flexible, adaptable options. We design engagement to fit different education systems and calendars.</p>
      <ul class="process-list">
        <li><strong>Internship or fellowship programs aligned with academic terms.</strong> Timelines can follow semesters, trimesters, or academic years as relevant to your institution.</li>
        <li><strong>Final-year capstone or project collaboration.</strong> Where it fits, students can align capstone or final-year projects with real DeepTrics work, with clear learning outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional faculty coordination and mentoring.</strong> We can align with faculty for mentorship, evaluation, or credit alignment where your processes allow — without adding undue burden.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote or hybrid engagement models.</strong> Students can participate remotely or in hybrid setups, so geography and campus constraints are less of a barrier.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are open to discussing what works best for your institution.</p>
